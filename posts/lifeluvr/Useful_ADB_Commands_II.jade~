For this tutorial you will need to have _ADB_ installed on your computer, your Android's _USB Debugging_ set to _ON_ and your device plugged into your computer! Ready?

Today, we're going to make a full backup of your Android device. This backup doesn't take up any space on your Android and, you can restore your backup just by plugging in your device!

First, on your computer, let's make a new folder somewhere handy (mine's on my Desktop) and, name it "Android Backup". Next, open your new folder and right-click on an empty space and select "Open in terminal" (for Windows, press and hold 'Shift' when you right-click).

The first command we're going to look at is:

~$ adb backup -all

After you press 'Enter', you will be asked to confirm this on your Android device. Set a password if you want your backup to be encrypted or, just leave it blank and tap "Back up my data".

This will make a new file in your Android Backup folder called, "backup.ab". However, technically speaking, you've only backed up the device and app data. 

We can add different levels of backups by applying "Attributes" just like the "-all" portion of our backup command. Here are some exaples and what they do:

~$ adb backup -all -apk

* This adds a backup of the installed .apk files. Add "-system" or "-no system" if you want to specify. 

There are more attributes you can add but, for this article we'll move onto our next command:

~$ adb restore /file/you want/to restore

Here is where I like to use _drag n' drop_. Type, "adb restore " (space after restore). Then _drag n' drop_ the backup.ab file onto the terminal and press 'Enter'.

That's it! Now you know how to backup and restore your Android device using _ADB_!
